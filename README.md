# Description of code

This program creates two Player objects (playerA and playerB) with their respective attributes (health, strength, attack). It then simulates the game where players take turns attacking and defending until one player's health reaches 0. The attack and defense are determined by rolling a 6-sided dice for each player. The damage inflicted is calculated based on the player's attack and the dice roll, while the defense is based on the player's strength and the dice roll. Finally, it prints the outcome of each attack and declares the winner of the game.
