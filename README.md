# GamePlayer
This Java program simulates a battle between two players (playerA and playerB) in a magical arena. Players attack and defend using randomly rolled 6-sided dice, inflicting damage based on their attack and strength attributes. The game ends when one player's health reaches 0, determining the winner.
